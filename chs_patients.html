		<h1>For Patients</h1>
		<p>Carolina Health Specialists' goals are to give you an understanding of
		wellness in hopes of achieving a healthier, happier lifestyle by supporting
		your health care goals. Please read the information below which describes some
		of our practice policies and procedures.</p>
		<h2>Appointments</h2>
		<p>Our offices are open Monday through Friday from 8am until 5:00pm. Please
		call (843) 497-5929 to schedule an appointment, or refer to the new patient
		portal for scheduling. New patient appointments and annual physical exams are
		30 minutes and follow-up appointments are 15 minutes. If you need to cancel
		an appointment please try to do so 24 hours prior to your appointment. If you
		are unavoidably late please call and let us know.</p>
		<h2>Labs</h2>
		<p>If you need a cholesterol panel or a fasting blood sugar checked you should
		arrive fasting for your lab work. Several of our laboratory locations are open
		at 7:30 am to accommodate our fasting and Diabetic patients. Appointments for 
		early morning laboratory collections are recommended.<br><br>
		As a courtesy to our patients, and to improve the speed and quality of our testing
		process, our office uses <i><b>ResultsCall™</b></i> to deliver your confidential 
		test results. Once your results are reviewed, our system will notify you that your 
		test results are available for retrieval. At that time you do not need to call our 
		office to pick up the results of your tests; simply follow the instructions below to
		access your test results any time of the day or night.</p>
		<h3>To Access Your Results by Phone:</h3>

			<li>When prompted for your eight-digit date of birth, enter two digits for the month,
			two digits for the day, and four digits for the year. (Example: September 4, 1980 
			would be entered 09/04/1980)</li>
			<li>When prompted for your phone number, enter your 10-digit telephone number, which 
			includes your area code. This should be the same number we used to let you know that
			your results are ready for retrieval.</li>
			<li>If you have tried to retrieve your test results before being notified by <i><b>ResultsCall™</b></i>
			and the system does not recognize your PIN or other personal identifier numbers, this 
			means your test results are not ready for retrieval. Please try calling later.</li>
