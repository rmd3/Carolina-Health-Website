			<h2>Attention!</h2>
			<p>All Co-Pays and Deductibles are Due at the Time of 
			Appointment</p>
			<h2>Important Notice Regarding Upcoming Appointments and 
			Covid</h2>
			<p>In order to better protect the safety of it's patients 
			and employees, Carolina Health Specialists are currently 
			requiring all patients to wear some form of face covering 
			before entering any Carolina Health Specialists facility. 
			Medical masks are preferred. Any patient who arrives 
			without a form of face covering will be turned away at 
			the door. Additionally, in an attempt to limit the number
			of people in our waiting rooms in order to better adhere 
			to social distancing guidelines, Carolina Health 
			Specialists will not allow visitors to accompany patients
			inside the building for their appointments. Therefore, we
			recommend that all patients attend their appointments by 
			themselves. However, if that is not possible, we will 
			require all visitors who accompany patients to their
			appointment to remain outside of the building and wait in
			the parking lot. Exceptions will be made for visitors of 
			patients who require assistance due to medical reasons. 
			If a visitor is allowed into the building, they must also 
			wear some form of face covering as described above. Thank
			you in advance for your understanding and for working with
			us to ensure the safety of our patients and staff. We do 
			not currently have the COVID vaccine. The government is in
			charge of distributing the vaccine and setting the order 
			of who receives the vaccine and when. Please see the SC 
			DHEC website for more information on the distribution and
			the timetable for different groups to receive the vaccine.
			We have applied to be a vaccine administration site. We 
			will send out updates once they become available. </p>
